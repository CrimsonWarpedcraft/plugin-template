| 1.21.7  | 4.0.15        |

This chart would make more sense if this plugin actually did anything and people would have a reason
to be looking for older releases to run on older servers.

To use this as a template, just use the latest version of this project and update the PaperMC
version as needed. See more info on release stability below.

#### Release and Versioning Strategy
Stable versions of this repo are tagged `vX.Y.Z` and have an associated [release](https://github.com/CrimsonWarpedcraft/plugin-template/releases).

Testing versions of this repo are tagged `vX.Y.Z-RC-N` and have an associated [pre-release](https://github.com/CrimsonWarpedcraft/plugin-template/releases).

Development versions of this repo are pushed to the master branch and are **not** tagged.

| Cron              | yyMMdd-HHmm-SNAPSHOT  | Build, test, and notify          | No                    |
| Push to `main`    | 0.0.0-SNAPSHOT        | Build, test, release, and notify | No                    |
| Tag `vX.Y.Z-RC-N` | X.Y.Z-SNAPSHOT        | Build, test, release, and notify | Pre-release           |

### Discord Notifications
In order to use Discord notifications, you will need to create two GitHub secrets. `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_ID` 
should be set to the id of your Discord webhook. `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` will be the token for the webhook.

You can find these values by copying the Discord Webhook URL:  
`https://discord.com/api/webhooks/<DISCORD_WEBHOOK_ID>/<DISCORD_WEBHOOK_TOKEN>`

Optionally, you can also configure `DISCORD_RELEASE_WEBHOOK_ID` and `DISCORD_RELEASE_WEBHOOK_TOKEN`
to send release announcements to a separate channel.

For more information, see [Discord Message Notify](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/discord-message-notify).

## Creating a Release
Below are the steps you should follow to create a release.

1. Create a tag on `main` using semantic versioning (e.g. v0.1.0)
2. Push the tag and get some coffee while the workflows run
3. Publish the release draft once it's been automatically created

## Building locally
Thanks to [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), building locally is easy no matter what platform you're on. Simply run the following command:

```text
./gradlew build
```

This build step will also run all checks and tests, making sure your code is clean.

JARs can be found in `build/libs/`.
