### Release Info
#### PaperMC Version Mapping
Here's a list of the PaperMC versions and the versions of this latest compatible version.

| PaperMC | ExamplePlugin |
|---------|---------------|
| 1.21    | 3.12.0+       |
| 1.20.6  | 3.11.0        |
| 1.20.4  | 3.9.3         |
| 1.20.2  | 3.8.4         |
| 1.20.1  | 3.7.1         |
| 1.19.4  | 3.2.1         |
| 1.18.2  | 3.0.2         |
| 1.17.1  | 2.2.0         |
| 1.16.5  | 2.1.2         |

This chart would make more sense if this plugin actually did anything and people would have a reason
to be looking for older releases to run on older servers.

To use this as a template, just use the latest version of this project and update the PaperMC
version as needed. See more info on release stability below.

#### Release and Versioning Strategy
Stable versions of this repo are tagged `vX.Y.Z` and have an associated [release](https://github.com/CrimsonWarpedcraft/plugin-template/releases).

Testing versions of this repo are tagged `vX.Y.Z-RC-N` and have an associated [pre-release](https://github.com/CrimsonWarpedcraft/plugin-template/releases).

Development versions of this repo are pushed to the master branch and are **not** tagged.

| Cron              | yyMMdd-HHmm-SNAPSHOT  | Build, test, and notify          | No                    |
| Push to `main`    | 0.0.0-SNAPSHOT        | Build, test, release, and notify | No                    |
| Tag `vX.Y.Z-RC-N` | X.Y.Z-SNAPSHOT        | Build, test, release, and notify | Pre-release           |

### Discord Notifications
In order to use Discord notifications, you will need to create two GitHub secrets. `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_ID` 
should be set to the id of your Discord webhook. `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` will be the token for the webhook.

You can find these values by copying the Discord Webhook URL:  
`https://discord.com/api/webhooks/<DISCORD_WEBHOOK_ID>/<DISCORD_WEBHOOK_TOKEN>`

For more information, see [Discord Message Notify](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/discord-message-notify).

## Creating a Release
Below are the steps you should follow to create a release.

1. Create a tag on `main` using semantic versioning (e.g. v0.1.0)
2. Push the tag and get some coffee while the workflows run
3. Publish the release draft once it's been automatically created

## Building locally
Thanks to [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), building locally is easy no matter what platform you're on. Simply run the following command:

```text
./gradlew build
```

This build step will also run all checks and tests, making sure your code is clean.

JARs can be found in `build/libs/`.
